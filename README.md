# 📱 Try On Room Application
### Mobile-Based Virtual Fitting Room with 3D Avatars & Augmented Reality  
_Final Year Project (FYP)_

---

## 📌 Project Overview
**My Fit Avatar** is a mobile-based virtual fitting room application that allows users
to generate a personalized **3D avatar** based on body measurements and visualize
selected **3D clothing models in an augmented reality (AR) environment**.

This project aims to enhance the online clothing try-on experience by improving
size accuracy, realism, and user engagement through immersive mobile technologies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To develop a mobile virtual fitting room using Flutter
- To generate realistic 3D avatars based on user body measurements
- To integrate augmented reality for real-time clothing visualization
- To enhance 3D texture quality using AI-based image enhancement
- To store and manage user measurement data securely using Firebase

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools Used

### 📱 Mobile Development
- **Flutter (Dart)** – Cross-platform mobile application
- **Firebase API**
  - Authentication
  - Cloud Firestore (user measurements & data storage)

### 🧍‍♂️ 3D Modeling & Design
- **MakeHuman** – Base human model generation
- **Blender** – 3D model refinement and customization
- **Marvelous Designer** – 3D clothing design and simulation

### 🧠 Image Enhancement
- **Real-ESRGAN**
  - AI-based image super-resolution
  - Enhances clothing texture quality for realism

### 🌐 Augmented Reality
